# Fake News Detection

Binary fake/real news classifier built with the "Fake and Real News" dataset. Includes data loading, robust text preprocessing, TFâ€‘IDF feature extraction, model selection (Logistic Regression, SVC) with hyperparameter search, evaluation (confusion matrix, ROC), and visualizations (feature importance, word clouds). Notebook-oriented and reproducible.

## Features

- Text preprocessing including contraction expansion, stopword removal, lemmatization, and number conversion
- TF-IDF feature extraction from reviews
- Logistic Regression classification for sentiment prediction
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Batch prediction support
- Streamlit UI demo for interactive sentiment analysis

## Project Structure

- `model.pkl` `vectorizer.pkl` - model and vectorizer files
- `Fake News Detection.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing preprocessing, training, and evaluation pipeline
- `app.py` - Streamlit application script for live sentiment analysis
- `requirements.txt` - Required Python packages
- `README.md` - Project overview and usage instructions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
``` powershell
git clone https://github.com/MohamedGamal04/Fake-News-Detection.git
cd Fake-News-Detection
```
2. Create a Python environment and activate it (recommended):
``` powershell
conda create -n classification-env python=3.8
conda activate classification-env
```
3. Install dependencies:
``` powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Download necessary NLTK data resources:
``` python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```

## Usage

- Train the model and evaluate using the Jupyter Notebook.
- To use the Streamlit app (once created and set up), run:
``` terminal
streamlit run app.py
```

- The Streamlit UI allows you to enter reviews manually or upload CSV files for batch prediction.

## Dataset

This project uses the [Fake and Real News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).
